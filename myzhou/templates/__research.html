                        Investigated the potential security problem in the authentication between the cloud and third-party servers.
                        Validated the attack model through proof-of-concept experiments on Google Home. Found out an erroneous implementation of the OAuth protocol on Google Home.

                        Investigated the factors that impact Swarm users' behavior of sharing their check-ins to Twitter. Used statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms to evaluate the influence of factors. 
                        The results can help researchers identify whether their Twitter-collected check-ins can represent the user behavior on Swarm.

                        Measured the performance of TCP with CUBIC, TCP with BBR, MPTCP in the high-speed environment. Developed a tool to split the mixed TCP packets into independent TCP flows. 
                        Wrote Python scripts to match the data packets collected from mobile phones with those from computers and servers. 
                        Used BladeRF to collect data of the link layer in order to find out the reason of performance changes.
